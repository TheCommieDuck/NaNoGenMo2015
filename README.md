# NaNoGenMo2015
National Novel Generation Month 2015

Main issue and devblog-y updates here: https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/issues/22

A rough overview:

I've decided on two driving points:
a) Given how much work people have put into narrative generation and yet even the best academic systems aren't there yet, trying to do something of that scale in a month is silly.
b) I'm a borderline perfectionist and wouldn't be overly happy with something 'meh' just because I tried doing far too much.

As such, I'm still going to be trying to do far too much! But...differently!

A rough overview of my plans - for now:
1- Get a very rough propp-based plot. Translate the plots into goals (e.g. the 'return' Propp function is a goal to end up at location X).
2- Throw in a whole bunch of characters, locations, objects, etc. I'll see if a corpus exists, otherwise I'll probably manually find some from e.g. IF games.
3- Give each character a small number of emotions and beliefs - e.g. hunger, safety, greed, whatever. This is the novel bit, I think. it's also the bit most likely to completely fall flat.
4- Let the characters run amok ala The Swallows (which I must say is absolutely brilliant and has given me and my friends a sore throat from laughing). 
5- Generate the story - which, I am hoping, might end up looking a little like something from dwarf fortress. Everyone loves a dwarf grabbing a goblin by the tongue with their pinky, ripping it out, and beating them to death with it!

1) shouldn't be too hard - the resource list in @MichaelPaulukonis' NaNoGenMo2014 is absolutely staggering. Originally I was talking about using Plotto for a plot, but that's just going to lead to extreme templatisation - something I don't really want at all.
2) also shouldn't be bad. Worst case? Grab an ontology or similar and go to town. Could be downright hilarious if, for instance, the hero really needs to go collect the magical Acetaldehyde Ethyl Phenylethyl Acetal by riding in his Alfa Romeo 155. Which goes about 5mph.
3) This is where it all falls down, I imagine. I've been interested in this kindof model but never really looked into it. We'll have to see!
4) Shouldn't be too hard. Just got to make sure I add some kind of urgency so we don't get them running around in circles for too long.
5) Also not too bad.

Anyway, we'll see.
